## Currently working on:


## Deployment
- app not deploying succesfully on digital ocean. Maybe try using the bitnami image, since that launched on it's own?

## Bugs
- perft not generating the correct number of legal moves after cetain depth. [maybe black tries to capture the king? who knows]

## Features
- Improve aesthetics of the timer.
- Make the timer functional. Set start time using the config menu

- perf optimisations

- implement draw if there is not enough material for both sides to checkmate (kings only)
- implement draw if 50 moves pass without a piece being captured

- remove circular dependencies between board, pieces and rules submodules
